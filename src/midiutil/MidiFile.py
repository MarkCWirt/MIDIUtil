        Equality operator for Generic Events and derived classes.

        In the processing of the event list, we have need to remove duplicates.
        To do this we rely on the fact that the classes are hashable, and must
        therefore have an equality operator (__hash__() and __eq__() must both
        be defined).

        This is the most embarrassing portion of the code, and anyone who knows
        about OO programming would find this almost unbelievable. Here we have
        a base class that knows specifics about derived classes, thus breaking
        the very spirit of OO programming.

        I suppose I should go back and restructure the code, perhaps removing
        the derived classes altogether. At some point perhaps I will.

            A Note on File Formats
            ----------------------

            In previous versions of this code the file written was format 2
            (which can be thought of as a collection of independent tracks) but
            was identified as format 1. In this version one can specify either
            format 1 or 2.

            In format 1 files there is a separate tempo track which contains
            tempo and time signature data, but contains no note data. If one
            creates a single track format 1 file the actual file has two tracks
            -- one for tempo data and one for note data. In the track indexing
            the tempo track can be ignored. In other words track 0 is the note
            track (the second track in the file). However, tempo and time
            signature data will be written to the first, tempo track. This is
            done to try and preserve as much interoperability with previous
            versions as possible.

            In a format 2 file all tracks are indexed and the track parameter
            is interpreted literally.

            your sequencing software supports it, this should be left at its
            default value.

        The data format for this event is a little obscure.

        The ``denominator`` should be specified as a power of 2, with
        a half note being one, a quarter note being two, and eight note
        being three, etc. Thus, for example, a 4/4 time signature would
        have a ``numerator`` of 4 and a ``denominator`` of 2. A 7/8 time
        signature would be a ``numerator`` of 7 and a ``denominator``
        of 3.

        The ``clocks_per_tick`` argument specifies the number of clock
        ticks per metronome click. By definition there are 24 ticks in
        a quarter note, so a metronome click per quarter note would be
        24. A click every third eighth note would be 3 * 12 = 36.

        it thus:

            :class:`GenericEvent`

        This function should be provided as the ``key`` for both

        follows:

        * Events are ordered in time. An event that takes place earlier will
          appear earlier
        * If two events happen at the same time, the secondary sort key is
          ``ord``. Thus a class of events can be processed earlier than
          another. One place this is used in the code is to make sure that note
          off events are processed before note on events.
        * If time and ordinality are the same, they are sorted in the order in
          which they were originally added to the list. Thus, for example, if
          one is making an RPN call one can specify the controller change
          events in the proper order and be sure that they will end up in the
          file that way.
