        This is needed in order to allow GenericObject classes to be used

        the event list by storing all the objects in a set, and then
        reconstructing the list from the set.  The only real requirement
        for the algorithm is that the hash of equal objects must be equal.
        There is probably great opportunity for improvements in the hashing

            what the Standard MIDI File Format Specification calls "division".
            Ticks are the integer unit of time in the SMF, and in most if
            not all MIDI sequencers.  Common values are 120, 240, 384,
            480, 960. Note that all these numbers are evenly divisible by
            2,3,4,6,8,12,16, and 24, except 120 does not have 16 as a divisor.

        :param eventtime_is_ticks: If set True means event time and duration
            argument values are integer ticks instead of fractional quarter
            notes.

        Note that the default for ``adjust_origin`` will change in a future
        release, so one should probably explicitly set it.
        
        In a format 1 file, it would be a rare cirumstance where adjusting the
        origin of each track to the track's first note makes any sense.

        Example:

        .. code::

            # Create a two-track MIDIFile

            from midiutil.MidiFile import MIDIFile
            midi_file = MIDIFile(1, adjust_origin=False)

        A Note on File Formats
        ----------------------

        In previous versions of this code the file written was format 2
        (which can be thought of as a collection of independent tracks) but
        was identified as format 1. In this version one can specify either
        format 1 or 2.

        In format 1 files there is a separate tempo track which contains
        tempo and time signature data, but contains no note data. If one
        creates a single track format 1 file the actual file has two tracks
        -- one for tempo data and one for note data. In the track indexing
        the tempo track can be ignored. In other words track 0 is the note
        track (the second track in the file). However, tempo and time
        signature data will be written to the first, tempo track. This is
        done to try and preserve as much interoperability with previous
        versions as possible.

        In a format 2 file all tracks are indexed and the track parameter
        is interpreted literally.

            quarter note. This is almost always 8 (the default), but some
            sequencers allow this value to be changed. Unless you know that
            your sequencing software supports it, this should be left at its
            default value.

        The data format for this event is a little obscure.

        The ``denominator`` should be specified as a power of 2, with
        a half note being one, a quarter note being two, and eight note
        being three, etc. Thus, for example, a 4/4 time signature would
        have a ``numerator`` of 4 and a ``denominator`` of 2. A 7/8 time
        signature would be a ``numerator`` of 7 and a ``denominator``
        of 3.

        The ``clocks_per_tick`` argument specifies the number of clock
        ticks per metronome click. By definition there are 24 ticks in
        a quarter note, so a metronome click per quarter note would be
        24. A click every third eighth note would be 3 * 12 = 36.

        The ``notes_per_quarter`` value is also a little confusing. It
        specifies the number of 32nd notes in a MIDI quarter note. Usually
        there are 8 32nd notes in a quarter note (8/32 = 1/4), so
        the default value is 8. However, one can change this value if
        needed. Setting it to 16, for example, would cause the music to
        play at double speed, as there would be 16/32 (or what could be
        considered *two* quarter notes for every one MIDI quarter note.

        Note that both the ``clocks_per_tick`` and the
        ``notes_per_quarter`` are specified in terms of quarter notes,
        even is the score is not a quarter-note based score (i.e.,
        even if the denominator is not ``4``). So if you're working with a
        time signature of, say, 6/8, one still needs to specify the clocks
        per quarter note.

        Registered/Non-Registered Parameter Number (RPN / NRPN)
        -------------------------------------------------------
        Controller number 6 (Data Entry), in conjunction with Controller numbers 96
        (Data Increment), 97 (Data Decrement), 98 (Registered Parameter Number LSB),
        99 (Registered Parameter Number MSB), 100 (Non-Registered Parameter Number
        LSB), and 101 (Non-Registered Parameter Number MSB), extend the number of
        controllers available via MIDI. Parameter data is transferred by first
        selecting the parameter number to be edited using controllers 98 and 99 or
        100 and 101, and then adjusting the data value for that parameter using
        controller number 6, 96, or 97.

        RPN and NRPN are typically used to send parameter data to a synthesizer in
        order to edit sound patches or other data. Registered parameters are those
        which have been assigned some particular function by the MIDI Manufacturers
        Association (MMA) and the Japan MIDI Standards Committee (JMSC). For
        example, there are Registered Parameter numbers assigned to control pitch
        bend sensitivity and master tuning for a synthesizer. Non-Registered
        parameters have not been assigned specific functions, and may be used for
        different functions by different manufacturers.

        The ``time_order`` parameter is something of a work-around for
        sequencers that do not preserve the order of events from the MIDI files
        they import. Within this code care is taken to preserve the order of
        events as specified, but some sequencers seem to transmit events
        occurring at the same time in an arbitrary order.  By setting this
        parameter to ``True`` something of a work-around is performed: each
        successive event (of which there are three or four for this event type)
        is placed in the time stream a small delta from the preceding one.
        Thus, for example, the controllers are set before the data bytes in
        this call.

        The ``time_order`` parameter is something of a work-around for

        they import. Within this code care is taken to preserve the order of
        events as specified, but some sequencers seem to transmit events
        occurring at the same time in an arbitrary order.  By setting this
        parameter to ``True`` something of a work-around is performed: each
        successive event (of which there are three or four for this event type)
        is placed in the time stream a small delta from the preceding one.
        Thus, for example, the controllers are set before the data bytes in
        this call.

          than another. One place this is used in the code is to make sure that

        * If event time and event ordinality are the same, they are sorted in
          the order in which they were originally added to the list. Thus, for
          example, if one is making an RPN call one can specify the controller
